## Costum HashMap Object

I made my own version of a hashmap because why not I guess.

I used Python's own hash function for calculating the index because I got lazy to implement my own decent hash function.

And yes I know hashmaps tipically use linked lists, I just didn't feel the need to use them.

Python's own dict is still faster than my Hashmap, of course. That is most likely because it uses C while I'm using pure Python (I hope)
